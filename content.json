  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Does getting a tattoo hurt?",
      "answer": "Pain levels vary based on placement, size, and individual pain tolerance. Areas with more muscle and fat typically hurt less than bony areas. Most clients describe it as manageable discomfort rather than severe pain. We take breaks as needed and work at your pace."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a tattoo session take?",
      "answer": "Small tattoos (2-3 inches) take 1-2 hours. Medium pieces (4-6 inches) take 2-4 hours. Large tattoos or detailed work may require multiple sessions of 4-8 hours each. We'll discuss timeline during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I prepare for my tattoo appointment?",
      "answer": "Get a good night's sleep, eat a full meal beforehand, stay hydrated, avoid alcohol 24 hours before, wear comfortable clothing that provides easy access to the tattoo area, and bring ID and any reference images."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the healing process like?",
      "answer": "Initial healing takes 2-3 weeks. Keep it clean, moisturized, and out of direct sunlight. Avoid swimming, soaking, and excessive sweating. Follow our detailed aftercare instructions. Full healing and color settling takes 3-4 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I bring my own design?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We love working with client ideas. Bring reference images, sketches, or descriptions. Our artists will refine and adapt the design to work beautifully as a tattoo, considering placement, size, and technical execution."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you do cover-ups?",
      "answer": "Yes! We specialize in transforming old or unwanted tattoos into beautiful new designs. Bring photos of your existing tattoo to your consultation and we'll discuss creative cover-up options."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your minimum age requirement?",
      "answer": "You must be 18 years or older with valid government-issued ID. We do not tattoo minors, even with parental consent, as per our studio policy and local regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer free touch-ups?",
      "answer": "Yes! We offer one free touch-up within 6 months of your original appointment, provided you've followed our aftercare instructions. This ensures your tattoo looks its absolute best."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does a tattoo cost?",
      "answer": "We charge NPR 5,000 per hour with a NPR 3,000 minimum. Final cost depends on size, complexity, placement, and artist. Book a free consultation for an accurate quote. We require a NPR 2,000 non-refundable deposit to secure your appointment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What safety and hygiene standards do you follow?",
      "answer": "We use hospital-grade sterilization, single-use needles, disposable gloves, and EPA-approved disinfectants. All equipment is autoclaved, and our studio meets all health department requirements. Your safety is our top priority."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get a tattoo if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?",
      "answer": "We recommend waiting until after pregnancy and breastfeeding for safety reasons. The risk of infection and the body's changing immune system make it best to postpone your tattoo."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I book an appointment?",
      "answer": "Contact us via WhatsApp at +977 9851234567, call us, or message on Instagram/Facebook. We'll schedule a free consultation to discuss your ideas, provide a quote, and book your session."
